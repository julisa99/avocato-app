# avocato

A project to automatically detect ripe avocados using a Bosch bme688 Sensor.

We automatically track the ripeness of avocados (or other fruits like bananas, mangoes, clementines, peaches, kiwis) by utilizing a specialized container, BME688 sensors and a model trained known gas metrics, and notify the user via smartphone app when they are best to eat.

The models for 3d printing the avocado enclosure (released under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) can be found in the `_3d_printing_models` directory. The trained AI algorithms from the BME AI Studio can be found in the `_bosch_ai_studio_algorithm` directory.

Made for the [Bosch Sensortec IoT Innovation Challenge](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/about-us/events/iot-innovation-challenge/) by [Lisa Ihde](https://github.com/julisa99) and [Sebastian Schulz](https://github.com/blblblu).
